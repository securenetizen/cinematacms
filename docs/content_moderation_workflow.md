by [Khairunnisa Isma Hanifah](https://github.com/KhairunnisaIsma)

CinemataCMS supports a structured yet flexible moderation process to ensure user-submitted media aligns with the platform’s mission: promoting independent, socially relevant films from the Asia-Pacific region.

This guide provides an overview of the contributors, user roles, media visibility, and moderation responsibilities in the system.

## 🎬 1. Video Submissions

Cinemata accepts uploads from a variety of contributors:

| Contributor Type        | Example Use Case                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Individual Filmmakers** | Publishing or archiving films publicly or privately.                            |
| **Advocacy Groups** | Distributing campaign or educational media.                            |
| **Festival Organizers** | Bulk uploading curated content for events or time-bound screenings.           |
| **Spam / Abusive Users** | Uploading ads, infringing content, or irrelevant media. Can be reported.   |

Uploads are moderated based on the user’s role and trust level.

## 🔐 2. User Roles & Upload Visibility

### Visibility States

CinemataCMS supports multiple media visibility states:

- `public`
- `private`
- `unlisted`
- `restricted`

> ✅ Confirmed in `cms/settings.py` and frontend (ViewerInfoTitleBanner.js)

### Default Upload Logic

| User Role       | Default Upload Visibility   | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trusted User** | User-defined (`public`, `private`, and `restricted` ) | Bypasses preliminary moderation; still subject to post-publish review |
| **Regular User** | `private`                   | Requires curator review before any public exposure                    |

> 🔎 **Trusted User** is a privilege granted by site admins.  
> See: [https://cinemata.org/cinemata-trusted-user](https://cinemata.org/cinemata-trusted-user)

**Technical References**:
- Upload logic: `uploader/`
- Roles/permissions: `users/models.py`

## 📣 3. Notification System

When a video is uploaded:

- An **automated email** is sent to the **Curatorial Team**.
- Email includes:
  - Uploader name
  - Media title
  - Visibility level
  - Link to the review queue

> ✅ Notification triggers confirmed in backend logic  
> 🔄 Optional: Slack/Mattermost alerts via webhooks.
